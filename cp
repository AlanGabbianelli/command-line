cp is a command used to copy files or directories.
"cp file_1 file_2" will copy the content of file_1 in file_2, creating file_2 if not existing, or substituing the content of file_2 if already existing.
"cp file_1 file_2 /dir/path/" will copy every file set as arguments (file_1 and file_2) into the directory /dir/path/, creating them if not existing, or substituing the content if existing.
"cp /dir_1/sub_dir_1/ /dir_2/sub_dir_2/" will copy all files of the first directory into the second one, creating all the files and directory not already existing.
